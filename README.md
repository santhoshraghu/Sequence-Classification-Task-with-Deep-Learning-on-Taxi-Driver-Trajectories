# Sequence-Classification-Task-with-Deep-Learning-on-Taxi-Driver-Trajectories

# Overview
In this project, I completed a sequence classification task using deep learning techniques. The task involved predicting the driver associated with each 100-step sub-trajectory extracted from the daily driving trajectories of five taxi drivers over a period of six months. The goal was to accurately attribute each sub-trajectory to the correct driver.

# Data Description
The dataset provided consisted of trajectory data from five taxi drivers, with features including:
- Plate: Anonymized identifier for each taxi driver (target label)
- Longitude: Longitude coordinates of the taxi
- Latitude: Latitude coordinates of the taxi
- Time: Timestamp of the record
- Status: Indicates whether the taxi is occupied (1) or vacant (0)


The task involved extracting sub-trajectories of 100 steps from a full-day trajectory of a taxi and predicting the driver associated with each sub-trajectory.
